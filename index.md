The matrix language Pacioli adds type safety and dimensional anaylysis
to mathematical software. Its parametric type system infers vector and
matrix types based on dimensioned vector spaces.


Pacioli is described in the <a href="manual.html">manual</a>. The <a
href="specification.html">specification</a> lists the available
functions.

A short introduction to units of measurements in Pacioli is in the <a
href="unit-inference.html">tutorial on unit inference</a>. The <a
href="matrices.html">tutorial on matrices</a> gives some examples of
the use of matrices in Pacioli. The <a href="kirchhof.html">Kirchhof
case</a> on the equilibrium in an eletrical network explains the use
of matrices.

Install Pacioli from the GitHub project. You can also view some
samples there.
